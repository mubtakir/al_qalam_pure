# Al-Qalam Pure: Technical Documentation (V5.0)

## 🏛️ Philosophy: Source-Code-as-Weights
Al-Qalam Pure is a radical neuro-symbolic AI system where intelligence is stored as **executable Python source code**. This eliminates "black box" binary models and allows for **Surgical Code Modification** in real-time.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

### 1. High-Level Reasoning (The Cortex)
- **`Cortex`**: The orchestrator of thoughts. It proactively identifies gaps in knowledge.
- **`Analogy discovery`**: Automatically finds cross-domain logical similarities.

### 2. Hypothetical Learning (The Dreamer)
- **`Dreamer`**: Simulates "What if" scenarios during idle time.
- **Autonomous Hypotheses**: Generates connections that, if found stable, are proposed to the user for adoption.

### 3. Linguistic Layer (The Narrator)
- **`ChatEngine`**: Translates Arabic natural language into logical commands.
- **`LinguisticNarrator`**: Transforms dry binary relationships into eloquent Arabic prose (Linguistic Eloquence).
- **Context memory**: Handles Arabic pronouns (هو، هي) by tracking the current subject of discourse.

### 4. Primordial Engine
- **`SelfWritingModel`**: Manages the lifecycle of rules and cells.
- **`AdaptiveParameter`**: Allows weights to exist as `# adaptive_slot` markers in Python files.
- **`Auditor`**: Ensures logical consistency across all generated code.

### 5. Pure Dynamic Transformer (V5.0)
- **`PureDynamicTransformer`**: Neuro-symbolic backbone with "Source-Code-as-Weights".
- **Adaptive Embedding**: Dynamically expands vocabulary during training.
- **Semantic Knowledge Map**: Automatically extracts and serializes discovered word relations into `knowledge_map.py`.
- **Symbolic Training Audit**: Trainer validates generated text against the Bayan logic engine in real-time.

## 📂 Codebase Overview
- `core/`: Foundation classes (Cells, Parameters, Model).
- `logic/`: Abstract reasoning definitions.
- `vault/auto_generated/`: The living memory (Source code weights).
- `brain_shell.py`: High-level immersive interface.
